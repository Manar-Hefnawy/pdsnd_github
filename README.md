### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project makes use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for
three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

Python code is used to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by
computing descriptive statistics

### Files used
*Bikeshare1.py
*Inputs.py
*chicago.csv
*new_york_city.csv
*washington.csv

## The Datasets
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

*Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
*End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
*Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
*Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
*End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
*User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

*Gender
*Birth Year

## Statistical questions answered
*most common month
*most common day of week
*most common hour of day
*most common start station
*most common end station
*most common trip from start to end
*total travel time
*average travel time
*counts of each user type
*counts of each gender
*earliest, most recent, most common year of birth
